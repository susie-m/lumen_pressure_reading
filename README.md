# lumen_pressure_reading

Enabling live reading, saving and plotting of pressure readings from a Honeywell pressure sensor connected to an Arduino Uno. Used for embryonic brain pressure recordings.

## Usage

Save pressure_read_write_plot.ipynb in a directory.Running this code with a Honeywell TruStability HSC Pressure Sensor connected to an Arduino Uno will generate csv files and a pressure plot with pressure in Pascals and time in seconds.

If you are working with Honeywell TruStability pressure sensors, you might find the [Honeywell TruStability SPI Library](https://github.com/huilab/HoneywellTruStabilitySPI) useful for your project. It explains how to communicate with the sensors using an Ardunino Uno.
